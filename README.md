a basic CMD application designed to make converting text files for use in android studio alot quicker 
## How To Use
simply copy all of your TTF/OTF files into a source folder if you dont have one the program will generate the default folder structure for you on start up this is as follows:
* Source Directory *C:\font\rawFonts*
* Destination Directory *C:\font\cookedFonts*
